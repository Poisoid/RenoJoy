This website that we created is for our renovation business called "RenoJoy". RenoJoy is an innovative web application designed to streamline and simplify the renovation process for homeowners and professionals alike.
The RenoJoy app aims to bring joy to the renovation experience by offering a user-friendly platform. The website combines project management, inspiration, and collaboration features such as community support to make the 
renovation process enjoyable and stress-free. RenoJoy strives to be the all-in-one solution for anyone embarking on a renovation journey. We tried to make the website as easy to use as possible by making it one page and 
scrollable. All the information needed is in the one page itself. The user can look at the website at ease with a glance. The colour used is striking and eye catching while being soothing to look at due to its green colour,
representing nature. Which shows we care about the nature while renovation homes. The clean website hopefully will make more users be able to use our website and increase our website exposure
